# Using Ansible with IOS-XE Devices   
This directory contains simple Ansible playbooks for interacting with IOS-XE devices. I have included a hosts file in both ini and YAML format as examples. The only device in the host files is the Always-on DevNet Sandbox CSR1000v, though these playbooks should still work if you have a physcial IOS-XE router. I have also included a config file that disables host key checking, so disabling it in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg should not be neccessary.
